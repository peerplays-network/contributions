# PeerPlays-Network Community Contributions

This document shows how the repositories in this organization fit
together and how code merges from different development companies and
contributors into corresponding repositories. These changes are
intended to produce a simpler and more transparent code management
process for contributors, and continue Peerplays development processes
becoming increasingly community-based and decentralized.

## Structure

* [**Pull Requests**]: Every organization/company and contributor is
  supposed to have **their own repositories** from where pull request to
  the community repositories can happen.

* [**Single Chain**]: Every repository in this organization is supposed
  to connect and work with the PeerPlays **main** network (a.k.a.
  *Alice*). Hence, stable releases are in a `master` or `alice` branch.

* [Testnets] Testnets are operated individually, such as Beatrice
  testnet, which is operated by a group of Peerplays Witnesses, using code
  published by [PBSA](https://github.com/PBSA/peerplays/tree/beatrice).

## Repositories

Businesses are free to request forking of their repositories into the
community organization to allow community contributors to push their
code. Software in this organization is supposed to work out-of-the box
and operate on Alice by default.
